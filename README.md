# Rating Bitcoin Wallets

If any decision I made here is not clear or you find debatable, please open an issue. 

This writeup is intended to be an improvement on [Jonas Schnelli's](https://github.com/jonasschnelli) Bitcoin wallet triangle, [presented](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XORDEX-RrAI&feature=youtu.be&t=3440) at the Building on Bitcoin 2018 conference.

Jonas rated the wallets in three main categories: privacy, trust and security. I add ease of use to this.

# Privacy

## Blockchain Level

Can the wallet sufficiently withstand blockchain analysis? 

## Network Level

Does the wallet get to know the current state of the blockchain without leaking relevant information to any third party?

# Trust

Full Nodes - SPV nodes - Centralized V

# Security

# User Experience (UX)
